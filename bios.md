### Bios

#### Julie Stone Peters

To be asked to write a bio for a coven on The Craft that is to meet on Iberian Nights is to be invited to imagine 1001 other selves. Here in this prosaic world, my bio says: H. Garbedian Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, Affiliated Faculty at Columbia Law School, Global Professorial Fellow at Queen Mary Law School in London, author of **Theatre of the Book** and **Law as Performance** (titles that may in another universe turn out to be Borges parodies), a writer on law, customs, witchcraft, democracy, technology, the police. But in Iberian Nights, I am something different altogether: a carpenter, a witch of the recamier, a haunter of prisons, a lover of thresholds, an apprentice to The Craft, a teacher of tales.
