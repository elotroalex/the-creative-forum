        <p>
          Now more than ever, we are asked to think about our cultures and
          predicaments through a bevy of disciplines and lenses. The Creative
          Forum accepts the challenge. Our mission is simple: to bring together
          the creative arts and scholarship in closer dialogue with one another
          to help us better understand the worlds we inherit, and inspire us to
          create new ones. We do this fully conscious of our mediatic and
          computational moment. We do this together, in belonging to and for one
          another. We do this out of a need masked as a choice. To our ends, we
          organize <a href="">encounters</a>, run <a href="">programs</a> and
          foster collaborative <a href="">projects</a>. Welcome. We hope you
          join us.
