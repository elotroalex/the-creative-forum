    <p></p>
    <p>Now more than ever, we are asked to think about our cultures and predicaments through a bevy of disciplines and lenses. The Creative Forum has one simple mission: to bring together the creative arts and scholarship in closer dialogue with one another to help us better understand the worlds we inherit, and inspire us to create new ones. We do this fully conscious of our mediatic and computational moment. We do this together, in belonging to one another. We do this out of a need masked as a choice. To our ends, we organize <a href="">encounters</a>, run <a href="">programs</a> and foster collaborative <a href="">projects</a>. Welcome. We hope you join us.</p>
