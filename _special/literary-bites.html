      <h2>Yale University | Fall 2023</h2>

      <p>
        Feast your mind and spirit on a delectable fusion of literature and
        intellectual nourishment with "Literary Bites," a Luncheon Series
        presented by the Creative Forum at Yale's Department of Spanish and
        Portuguese. We will bring together talented writers, scholars, and
        students for a unique fusion of literary discourse and intellectual
        stimulation. At these monthly catered lunches, we aim to serve up
        thought-provoking conversations about past and ongoing projects,
        showcase Yale's established and up-and-coming literary talents, and
        strive to transform our department into a thriving hub for literary
        creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each of our events revolves around the work of one or a few hosts. Each
        invited host is in charge of providing us with a twist on the
        traditional writing workshop or literary reading. In other words, each
        lunch comes with a plot twist! Come join us for a literary spread that
        will leave you savoring every word.
