## Who we are

The Creative Forum is an unlocated space at Yale for the exploration of the creative arts, scholarship, and their interstices. The Forum is housed at the Yale Department of Spanish & Portuguese, but welcomes all faculty, graduate researchers, undergraduate students and staff at Yale enthused by burgeoning forms of collective, experimental, mobilized, public and digital humanities praxis. We are committed to the development of a community of practice that is inclusive, collaborative, interdisciplinary and oriented towards social justice and imaginative scholarship.

Responsibility and moderation for The Creative Forum is shared by:

## A brief history

The Creative Forum was founded in 2022 at the initiative of the chair of the [Department of Spanish & Portuguese](https://span-port.yale.edu), Jesús Velasco. Soon after, he asked Alex Gil to join him in shaping the direction of the Forum with the help of the first fellow, Gaëlle Le Calvez House. Planning for the Creative Forum occupied the team during the 2022—2023 academic year. That did not The Forum from beginning to sponsor and help organize a series of likeminded events in the Spring 2023. With the launch of the Forum's web home in the Fall of 2023, the team is now ready to begin the work of building a community of practice around the creative arts and scholarship at Yale in earnest. Onward.

## What we do

The Creative Forum pursues its mission through programs, events and projects. We are in the early stages of running a number of regular programs to support our mission, and welcome kin initiatives to join our umbrella. Our encounters are our bread and butter. We organize and host a variety of workshops, talks, and performances aligned with our mission. Last, but not least, we help incubate creative research projects and ideas through our project-based ateliers.
