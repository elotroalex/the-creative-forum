The Creative Forum is housed at the Yale Department of Spanish & Portuguese. We welcome all faculty, graduate researchers, undergraduate students and staff at Yale interested in the intesection of the creative arts and scholarship. Our doors are open to all collaborative, experimental, mobilized, public and digital humanities praxis.

Responsibility and moderation for The Creative Forum is shared by:

- [Alex Gil](https://span-port.yale.edu/people/jesus-velasco), Senior Lecturer II & Associate Research Faculty of Digital Humanities, Associate Director of the Creative Forum

## What we do

The Creative Forum is an unlocated space at Yale for the exploration of the creative arts and scholarship. We organize and host a variety of encounters, including workshops, talks, and performances. We also provide support for the incubation of new creative research projects and ideas through our impromptu ateliers. We are committed to the development of a community of practice that is inclusive, collaborative, and interdisciplinary.
