Join us in the first of the "Literary Bites" series, a thought-provoking literary event organized by the Creative Forum of Yale's Department of Spanish and Portuguese. In this event we will think about the act of writing, guided by the prompt, "El control de la frase" we will seek to explore the boundaries of literature by focusing on the art of phrase crafting.

Alan Mendoza Sosa, Sofía Fernández González, Mayte López, and Alfredo Adonie Kraushaar (NYU), will be in dialogue with Katherina Frangi, collectively questioning and redefining the boundaries of what is writable. The "Literary Bites" series aims to challenge conventional perspectives on literature, inviting you to participate in a conversation that transcends the limits of the written word.
