### Our guests and their papers

#### Hannah Rachel Cole

... is a Lecturer on History and Literature at Harvard University. Previously, she served as Postdoctoral Associate at Yale Environmental Humanities and the Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration after earning her Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Cornell University. Her current book project examines representations of “weedy” plants in the Caribbean in the aftermath of plantation slavery. She is also working on a digital humanities project mapping literary representations of plant life in the region, accessible at www.botanicalimaginaries.com.

Hannah Cole will present "Thinking with Life at the Limits of the Caribbean Plantation."

**Abstract:** Donna Haraway has described the plantation as a site of “multispecies forced labor” in which complex arrays of life forms are radically simplified and the generation time of all actors is altered (Haraway and Tsing 5). Anna Tsing, speaking in conversation with Haraway, has described one of its characteristic traits as the simultaneous disciplining of people and of plants (Haraway and Tsing 6). Extending and complicating current theorizations of the Plantationocene, this paper examines the diverse forms of life that thrive at the edges of Caribbean monoculture plantations, among rows of cultivated crops, in the soil that sustains them, and in the fallow land abandoned plantations leave behind. Monoculture, I argue, always depends upon the uncultivated life forms at its margins. “Weedy” plants and mycorrhizal fungi offer alternative possibilities for multispecies lifeways when cash crop economies fall apart. I consider the stakes of thinking with the noncommercial life forms at the limits of Caribbean monoculture plantations, building upon Haraway’s and Puig de la Bellacasa’s theorizations of “thinking-with” as a mode of engagement with multispecies lifeworlds (Haraway 30; Puig de la Bellacasa 201). What does it mean to think with organisms that have not evolved for human consumption but whose lifeways are intricately enmeshed with our own? How do such life forms become subject to new modes of extraction in the ruins monoculture leaves behind? Do they have the power to dislodge what Vandana Shiva terms “monocultures of the mind?”

Her most recent publications are the co-edited volumes The Latin American Ecocultural Reader (2020), Pushing Past the Human in Latin American Cinema (2021), Un gabinete del futuro (2022) and Turbar la quietud (2023), the authored monograph Visualizing Loss in Latin America: Biopolitics, Waste, and the Urban Environment (2023), the novels Ischia (trad. from Spanish, 2023) and Cocodrilos en la noche (2020; 2023), the bilingual poem collection El cero móvil de su boca / The Mobile Zero of Its Mouth (2020) and the hybrid book Aquí no hubo ni una estrella (2023).

Heffes will present "Subversive Flora: Nutritive Aesthetics in Contemporary Latin America"

**Abstract:** In this working paper I will look at the countereffect of a wide number of recent publications and art productions where the garden, gardening, vegetal life and the “botanical imaginary” (Wylie 2021), as well as alternative figurations of flora and plants, nourish aesthetic worldmaking. These writings and visual artifacts catalyze what I define as a “nutritive aesthetics” that intentionally or unintentionally aims to mitigate the collapsing effect of our anthropogenic present. While the negative effects of contaminant substances had and continue to have a detrimental effect on human and non-human species, these works focus on microorganisms, extinction, and organic/non organic entanglements. They respond to violence ––whereas the silent one caused by the gradual effect of toxicants, or the brutal one triggered by ongoing practices of extractive imperialism––by evoking life and vitality in multiple and microorganic forms.
