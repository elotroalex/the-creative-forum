What happens when artificial intelligence meets conceptual poetry? This hands-on workshop invites participants to explore how tools like ChatGPT can inspire and shape poetic creation. From abstract ideas to evocative verses, participants will collaborate with AI to craft original poems, experimenting with imagery, tone, and form. Through this process, they will reflect on the unique interplay between human creativity and machine intelligence, broadening their understanding of what poetry can be.
