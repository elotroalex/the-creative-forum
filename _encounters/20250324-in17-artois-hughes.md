## About our Guest Speakers

**Florence d'Artois** (Toulouse, 1980) has been an Associate Professor in Hispanic Studies at the Sorbonne since 2012. Her research focuses on performance practices in Golden Age Spain. She is particularly interested in the aesthetic, emotional and political stakes involved in these practices, as well as the theoretical discourses that authorize them. She is the author of _Du nom au genre, Lope de Vega, la tragedia et son public_ (Madrid, Casa de Velázquez, 2017) and several editions of Lope de Vega (Parte XVI de comedias, Madrid, Gredos, 2017, co-edited with Luigi Giuliani).

Since 2019 she is a member of the Institut Universitaire de France for the project The performing body: dance, festivals and theater at the courts of the Hispanic Monarchy (1560-1700). In this context, she has written a book on the representational concepts at stake in the theory and practice of dance, _The Poetics turn: Dance, embodied politics and court culture in early modern Spain_ and coordinated an edited volume entitled _Corps, textes, archive(s). Éditer la danse de la première modernité_ (Paris, Garnier classiques, 2025) as well as an issue of the journal _XVIIe siècle_ (2023, 1) on the anti-dance controversy in early modern Europe (Contre la danse?). Between 2022 and 2024, together with Miguel Zugasti, she directed the program Panhispania festiva. Celebración, patrimonio, mentalidades (XVI-XVIII) at the Casa de Velázquez in Madrid.

**Nicole T. Hughes** is assistant professor in the Department of Iberian and Latin American Cultures at Stanford University. She researches the early modern world with a special focus on New Spain and Brazil in the sixteenth century. Her research has appeared or is forthcoming in Representations, Colonial Latin American Review, Word & Image, and Renaissance Quarterly, which awarded her honorable mention for the William Nelson Prize.

Her first book project, Stages of History: New Spain, Brazil, and the Theater of the World, analyzes theatrical spectacles in which missionaries, conquistadors, and Indigenous elites superimposed depictions of far-flung conflicts and interpretations of local struggles. She argues that by envisioning other parts of the world and relating those images back to the Americas, participants created foundational narratives of New Spain and Brazil.
