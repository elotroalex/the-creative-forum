Celestina used to work within a network of people with varied skills.
Most of the living ones (I'll make an exception of Sempronio) are
low lives, opportunists, or oppressed individuals with little agency of
their own. Among the people in this web, a dead one excels. Claudina, Pármeno's
mother, was (still is, in her memory) Celestina's soulmate. Beyond
anything else, they have been master witches. They are members of the
craft, of an unofficial guild of highly skilled artists who live a life
of danger and dispossession, but whose work cannot be more central to
the economy of relations taking place in both rural and urban centers.
They are an _infra_ structure.

The craft---let's just call it The Craft---is a connective tissue
within social and political networks. It is also not possible to
disentangle it from law and religion in those connective, tender tissues
of the social fabric. The Craft is part of the History of the Book,
Archival procedures, and documentary poetics. The Craft needs to be
addressed from a constellation of perspectives that includes gender,
queer, trans, race, disabilities, and every single one of their possible
intersections. The Craft defies periodization, the same it defies and
even challenges the historical need to set borderlines that are
national, imperial, linguistic, religious. The Craft is linked to
inquisitorial colonialism and to its dissidence. The Craft is so
powerful it does not even need to exist to be a transforming element of
society and politics.

The purpose of this colloquium---which marks the 11th and 12th nights of [our Iberian Nights series](https://creativeforum.yale.edu/special/iberian-nights.html)---is to share investigation across many
fields and academic interests about the practices and cultures of
witchcraft.

The colloquium on _The Craft_ will consist of a collective of scholars working
together for two days from different perspectives on the practices and
theories of Witchcraft. The material will be organized around the work
of five speakers:

- Lexie Cook (University of Durham, UK)
- Soazick Kerneis (Université de Paris, Nanterre)
- Julie Stone Peters (Columbia University)
- Paola Uparela (University of Florida)
- Kaiama Glover (Yale University)

We invite you to join us and be an active participant in our conversation. Please see the call for proposals below.

### Proposals:

Please send your proposals with the attached form, which is
self-explanatory. You can suggest:

- a talk (15 minutes)
- a lightning talk (3 minutes, fun)
- a poster
- an exhibit, either virtual or physical

We will ask for the text of your contributions to be sent at least two
weeks before the colloquium, so that other participants can read it and
contribute to the debate in an informed and engaged way. This will also
limit presentation times, and will foster longer discussions.
Organization of each panel will be related to the way in which proposals
converse with one another.

### Mini-grants:

Iberian Connections and The Creative Forum will offer 6 \$500
mini-grants to graduate students, independent and early-career
colleagues. Please complete the relevant portion of the form if you are
eligible to receive a mini-grant.

### Iberian Nights

#### Book One: Literature and Survival

This series is inspired by the spirit of Sheherazade, Dhuoda, Christine de Pizan, Teresa de Cartagena, the pequeñas mujeres rojas and so many others for whom the practice of literature---in many of its facets---was the matter of survival. They existed in circumstances of physical and sexual violence, of civil war, of racial discrimination, of isolation; they also lived in circumstances that cannot be properly expressed outside their own experiments with literature.

Our guests write from many directions, for many audiences, for many souls. Novels, reviews, the lives of afrodescendent people, dance, race, sexual violences, asylum briefs, and so many other forms of polyhedric writing that explore the limits of literature---and those of survival. They will be in conversation about their work, about their thought and, certainly, about the joys and frustrations of the literary worlds they inhabit. To see our full Fall schedule, please visit our [Iberian Nights page](https://creativeforum.yale.edu/special/iberian-nights.html)..
